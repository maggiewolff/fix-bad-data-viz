To Do:
1. Click on the "data" folder above to access the data.
2. Do whatever you think is best to join and clean the data. Use whatever tool you're comfortable with or want to practice using. 
3. Create a better data visualization to tell the story of the data.
4. Summarize your process and insights and post wherever you put your projects. 
5. If you'd like, share it on social media and tag me! @data.story.teller on Instagram and Threads or @data_storyteller on TikTok.
6. I'll share what I did with the data in a future issue of my [newsletter](https://datastoryteller.substack.com/).
